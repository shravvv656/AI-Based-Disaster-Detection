# AI-Based Disaster Detection and Response from Satellite Images

This project focuses on developing an AI-based system for detecting disasters from satellite images and enabling faster response strategies. The goal is to leverage deep learning models to classify and localize disaster-affected areas using grayscale satellite imagery.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

- **Objective**: Detect disasters (e.g., floods, fires, earthquakes) in grayscale satellite images.
- **Dataset**: Satellite images in grayscale format, annotated for disaster vs. non-disaster classes.
- **Models Used**: Comparison and evaluation of five deep learning models:
  - **Swin Transformer**
  - **UNet**
  - **DeepLabV3+**
  - **ResNet-50**
  - **Vision Transformer (ViT)**

- **Implementation**: Each model is trained for 75 epochs and evaluated for performance in disaster detection.
- **Novelty**: Adapting and comparing state-of-the-art segmentation and classification models on grayscale satellite imagery, where color-based information is limited.
